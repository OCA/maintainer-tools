# OCA Maintainers Tools

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:OCA/maintainers-tools.git
    $ cd maintainers-tools
    $ virtualenv env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install

## OCA repositories tools

These tools are mostly for maintenance purpose only.
They are used by OCA maintainers to address common operations across all repos.

**Prerequisite**

Get a token from Github.

    $ oca-github-login USERNAME


NOTE: you may have to delete the existing one from
"Account settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens".


### Sync team users from community.odoo.com to GitHub teams

Goal: members of the teams should never be added directly on GitHub.
They should be added on https://community.odoo.com. This script will
sync all the teams from Odoo to GitHub.

Prerequisites:

* Your odoo user must have read access to the projects and users;
* The partners on odoo must have their GitHub login set otherwise they won't
  be added in the GitHub teams;
* Your GitHub user must have owners rights on the OCA organization to be
  able to add or remove members;
* The odoo project must have the same name than the GitHub teams.

Run the script in "dry-run" mode:

    $ oca-copy-maintainers --dry-run

Apply the changes on GitHub:

    $ oca-copy-maintainers

The first time it runs, it will ask your odoo's username and password.
You may store them using the `--store` option, but watch out: the password is stored in clear text.


### Set labels on OCA repository on GitHub

Set standardized labels to ease the issue workflow on all repositories with same colors.
This tools will also warn you what are the specific labels on some repository

    $ oca-set-repo-labels


### Clone all OCA repositories

The script `oca-clone-everything` can be used to clone all the OCA projects:
create a fresh directory, use oca-github-login (or copy oca.cfg from a place
where you've already logged in) and run oca-clone-everything.

The script will create a clone for all the OCA projects registered on
github. For projects already cloned, it run `git fetch --all` to get the
latest versions.

If you pass the `--organization-remotes
<comma-separated-list>` option, the script will also add remotes for the listed
accounts, and run `git fetch` to get the source code from these forks. For instance:

    $ oca-clone-everything --organization-remotes yourlogin,otherlogin

will create two remotes, in addition to the default `origin`, called
`yourlogin` and `otherlogin`, respectively referencing
`git@github.com:yourlogin/projectname` and
`git@github.com:otherlogin/projectname` and fetch these remotes, for all the
OCA projects. It does not matter whether the forks exist on github or not, and
you can create them later.


## Quality tools

These tools are meant to be used both by repo maintainers and contributors.
You can leverage them to give more quality to your modules and to respect OCA guidelines.


### README generator

To provide high quality README for our modules we generate them automatically.
The sections of the final README are organized in fragments.
They must be put inside a `readme` folder respecting [this structure|./readme].

eg.
To generate the final README for the module `auth_keycloak`:

    $ oca-gen-addon-readme --repo-name=server-auth --branch=10.0 --addon-dir=auth_keycloak

The result will be a fully PyPI compliant README.rst in the root of your module.

You may also use this script for your own repositories by specifying this 
additional argument `--org-name=myorganisation`


### Icon generator

To provide an icon for our modules we generate them automatically.

To generate the icon for the module `auth_keycloak`:

    $ oca-gen-addon-icon --addon-dir=auth_keycloak


### Auto fix pep8 guidelines

To auto fix pep8 guidelines of your code you can run:

    $ oca-autopep8 -ri PATH

This script overwrite with monkey patch the original script of [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)
to support custom code refactoring.

* List of errors added:

    - `CW0001` Class name with snake_case style found, should use CamelCase.
    - `CW0002` Delete vim comment.

More info of original autopep8 [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/)

You can rename snake_case to CamelCase with next command:

    $ oca-autopep8 -ri --select=CW0001 PATH

You can delete vim comment

    $ oca-autopep8 -ri --select=CW0002,W391 PATH


## Developers

As a developer, you want to launch the scripts without installing the
egg.

    $ git clone git@github.com:OCA/maintainers-tools.git
    $ cd maintainers-tools
    $ virtualenv env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -e .

**Run tests**

    $ tox  # all tests for all python versions
    $ tox -e py27  # python 2.7
    $ tox -- -k readme -v  # run tests containing 'readme' in their name, verbose

**Get a token from Github**

    $ python -m tools.github_login USERNAME

**Run a script**

    $ python -m tools.copy_maintainers

You can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to specify the token

    $ GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx python -m tools.copy_maintainers

**Install pre-commit**

May be this section should be move to https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools/wiki#how-to

To ensure your commits are not made without pre-commit check executing this command,
you can include it in your computer's git hook:

```
pip install pre-commit
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.git/hooks
mkdir -p ~/.git/hooks
touch ~/.git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ~/.git/hooks/pre-commit
```
Create a pre-commit file with the following content:
```
#!/bin/sh
pre-commit run -a
```
Now just commit that the validations are executed automatically

Good code!
